meta\_designer
=====================

This is script is used to generate the phase-geometry curve starting from the the intended focal length and other parameters that determine the desired properties of the metasurfaces. Using this curve it calculates the necessary phase shifts and corresponding geometries of the metasurface elements. The cylindrical posts are assumed to be located in a hexagonal lattice.
