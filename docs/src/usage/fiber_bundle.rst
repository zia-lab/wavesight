fiber\_bundle
====================

This script is used to configure the bash scripts necessary to run the sequence of simulations necessary to describe launching the guided modes of a waveguide, propagating them across the gap between the fiber and the metalens, propagating them across a designed metalens, and then finally propagating them in the homogeneous space describing the host medium.
