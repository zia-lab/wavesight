Welcome to wavesight
=====================================

`wavesight` is a set of assorted computational electromagnetism tools that may be used to the folowing ends:

* Generate numerical bases for the propagation modes of a step-index optical fiber.
* Propagate electromagnetic fields across a homogeneous medium using vectorial diffraction integrals.
* Estimate the refraction of a given incident field upon a dielectric interface by a local refraction approximation based on the direction of the Poynting vector.
